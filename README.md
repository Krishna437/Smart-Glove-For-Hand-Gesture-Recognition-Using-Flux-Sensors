# Smart-Glove-For-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Flux-Sensors
A large percentage of the total population of the world can't speak. Sign language is the non-verbal form of communication method which is found among all deaf and dump communities. Normal people do not learn sign language, and it creates a barrier in their communication to deaf and dumb people. Hence to break this barrier we designed a system which converts hand gestures into auditory speech as well as text. The system makes use of flex sensors and Android technology. There are 2 modules, first is a glove with flex sensors and Atmel ATMEGA328PU microcontroller and the second is an android app with Google speech API.
